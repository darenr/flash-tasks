      def hello():
          # An example function

    heading: "Long Description Example"
    description: "This is a very long description to test the double width feature. It needs to be at least 200 characters long to trigger the layout change. We want to ensure that cards with substantial text content are given more space to improve readability. This helps user to read the content without feeling cramped.
