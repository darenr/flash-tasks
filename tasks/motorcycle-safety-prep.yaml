tasks:
  - heading: Gear Up for Success
    description: |
      Review the **required safety gear** list provided by your course (helmet, eye protection, jacket, gloves, pants, boots). *Inspect each item* for wear and ensure it fits comfortably and properly. A poorly fitting helmet or uncomfortable boots can be a major distraction!
      
      **Pro-tip**: Try on everything a few days before to ensure there are no surprises.
  - heading: Physical & Mental Warm-Up
    description: |
      Get a good night's sleep the day before. Hydrate well. Light stretching can also be beneficial, as you'll be using muscles you might not typically engage (especially in your core and legs). Mentally, try to relax and approach the course with an open mind, ready to learn.
  - heading: Basic Controls & Familiarity (Optional)
    description: |
      If you have access to a motorcycle beforehand (even a small one), take a moment to **re-familiarize yourself** with the basic controls:
      *   Clutch lever (left hand)
      *   Front brake lever (right hand)
      *   Throttle (right hand twist)
      *   Rear brake pedal (right foot)
      *   Shifter (left foot)
      
      Even just sitting on the bike and feeling where everything is can build confidence.
  - heading: Logistics & Course Day Essentials
    description: |
      Confirm the course location, start time, and parking details. Pack a small bag with:
      *   **Water bottle** (stay hydrated!)
      *   Snacks for energy
      *   Sunscreen / Lip balm
      *   Rain gear (just in case)
      *   Any required documentation (ID, course confirmation)
      *   A positive attitude!
  - heading: Know Your Machine (If Bringing Your Own)
    description: |
      If you are bringing your own motorcycle, ensure it's in good working order. Check the following:
      *   **Tires**: Proper inflation and tread depth.
      *   **Brakes**: Front and rear are functioning correctly.
      *   **Lights**: Headlight, taillight, turn signals are all operational.
      *   **Fluids**: Oil, coolant, brake fluid levels are good.
      *   **Chain/Belt**: Properly adjusted and lubricated.
      
      The instructors will often do a quick inspection, so ensure your bike is ready to roll safely.
